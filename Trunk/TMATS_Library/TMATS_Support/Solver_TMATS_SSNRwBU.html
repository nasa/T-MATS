        Purpose
</div>

<p>
    This block is used to supply the inputs to iteratively drive the outputs
    of a system to zero by using a T-MATS Newton Raphson Solver block in combination
    with a T-MATS Jacobian Calculator and the Sherman-Morrison (Good) Broyden Update Method blocks. The help files for the Newton Raphson Solver and the Jacobian Calculator blocks can be
    accessed by the following links:

    This block will perform its calculations in three steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Jacobian Calculator sends perturbations to the plant model that
        then calculates the initial plant Jacobian based on the system response.
        <li>Newton Raphson Solver will use the inverse of the Jacobian to
        iteratively step the system toward solution.
		<li> At each step, the differences between current and previous iterations for the dependents and independents are used to update the inverse of the Jacobian using the Sherman-Morrison (Good) Broyden Updade Method.
        <li> Once the solution has satisfied the conditions, the Newton
        Raphson Solver is shut off.
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Since this block uses the simulink simulation time step as the iteration steps for
    Jacobian calculation, Broyden Update, and Newton Raphson operations, the simulation time step should be set
    to allow for enough steps to solve the optimization. To this end the simulation should be
    set to use a fixed time step and the simulation stop time should be set to allow sufficient steps.
</p>

The block contains the following equations:
    <ol>
        <li>Newton-Raphson Method with Damping Term<br>
		\begin{equation}
			x_{n_{i+1}} = x_{n_i} - \frac{\lambda}{100}J^{-1}_if(x)_i
		\end{equation}
		\(i\) is the iteration number, subscript \(n\) denotes a term normalized with respect to the absolute value of its initial condition, \(x_{n_i}\) is the normalized independent at the current time step, \(\lambda\) is the damping factor, \(J^{-1}_i\) is the inverse of the Jacobian at the current time step, \(f(x)_i\) are the dependents at the current time step, and \(x_{n_{i+1}}\) are the normalized independents at the next time step.
		The Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives that describes the changes in the <u>normalized</u> independents with respect to the full scale dependents (\(x_n = \frac{x}{abs(x_o)}\) where \(x_o\) are the initial, full scale independents specified by the user in the mask and \(x\) are the full scale independents).
		<li>Sherman Morrison (Good) Broyden Update Method<br>
		\begin{equation}
			J^{-1}_i = J^{-1}_{i-1} + \frac{\Delta x_{n} - J^{-1}_{i-1} \Delta f(x)}{\Delta x_{n}^T J^{-1}_{i-1} \Delta f(x)} \Delta x_{n}^T J^{-1}_{i-1}
		\end{equation}
		\(J^{-1}_{i-1}\) is the inverse of the Jacobian at the previous time step, \( \Delta x_{n} = x_{n} - x_{n_{i-1}}\) is the change in the normalized independents between the current and previous time steps, suberscript \(T\) represents the transpose of an array, and  \( \Delta f(x) = f(x)_i - f(x)_{i-1}\) is the change in the dependents between the current and previous time steps.
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li> Connect the input function to the corresponding place on the block.
        <li> Connect the input command to enable the block.
        <li> Connect the outputs to the next blocks in the simulation.
        <li> Verify the the simulation is set to use a fixed time step and has a reasonable simulation stop time.
        <li> Double click the block and specify the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Jacobian perturbation size
            <li>Newton Raphson initial conditions
            <li>Newton Raphson dampening term where 100 and 50 indicate a 100% and 50% usage of the calculated change to the independent terms, respectively. This parameter modifies the convergence time and simulation robustness.

When using this block, you may receive one of the following errors/warnings. The table
below lists the errors/warnings that you may see and the reason why it is being displayed.

<p>
When using this block, there is also a possibility that the Newton Raphson
Solver will not converge to a solution. This can happen for a variety of
reasons, as listed below:
<ul>
    <li>The initial guess (initial condition) was not close enough to the
    desired root. This can cause the system to either diverge completely or converge
    on a secondary root of the function.
    <li>The derivative of the function is not well behaved, causing the system
    to overshoot the correct root and diverge.
    <li>The initial guess (or a resulting value after one or more iterations)
    is a point in the function for which the derivative is zero. This results
    in a divide-by-zero situation, and an error occurs.
    <li>The results of the solver hit one of the user-specified limits.
</ul>
