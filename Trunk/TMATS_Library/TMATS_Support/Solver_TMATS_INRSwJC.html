The Iterative Newton Raphson Solver with Jacobian Calculator block will
supply the inputs to iteratively drive the outputs of a system to zero.
<br>
<br>
This will be performed in three steps.<br>
1) Jabobian calculator sends Perturbations to the plant then calculates the plant
Jacboian based on the system response. <br>
2) The Newton Raphson will use the inverse of the Jacobian to iteratively step the
system toward solution.<br>
3) Once the solution has satisfied the conditions the Newton Raphson is shut off.<br>
<br>
This module is designed for dynamic systems and should be paired with
a "do... while" block in Simulink. The "do...while" block and this module
should both be located in the same subsystem as the plant that is to be solved for.
