<font size="6" color="Magenta">T-MATS: MATLAB functions</font>
<p>The T-MATS package contains MATLAB functions for doing certain Thermodynamic operations. Information about these sets of functions are located in the users manual.</p>
<p>As a quick reference the T-MATS functions are also located below. They can be accessed by using the class structure TMATS.* .</p>
<p> Units consist of:<br>
    temperature - R<br>
    pressure - psia<br>
    enthalpy = BTU/lbm<br>
    entropy - BTU/(lbm*R)<br>
FAR - NA</p>

<table border="1"> <tr><td> <b>Class Method</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>[T] = h2t(h)</td><td>Look up temperature(T) based on enthalpy(h).</td>
<tr><td>[h] = t2h(T)</td><td>Look up enthalpy(h) based on temperature(T)</td>
<tr><td>[s] = PT2s(T,P)</td><td>Look up entropy(s) based on pressure(P) and temperature(T)</td>
<tr><td>[T] = sP2T(s,P)</td><td>Look up temperature(T) based on entropy(s) and pressure(P)</td>
<tr><td>PlotCMap(NcV,WcA,PRA,EffA)</td><td>Plot compressor map based on an Nc vector, Wc array, PR array, and Eff array.
<br> addtional inputs can be included by with the format PlotCMap(_,Name,Value,...,Value)
<br> type "help TMATS.PlotCMap" for acceptable inputs and format.
<br> An exmaple of this command might look like: 
<br>TMATS.PlotCMap(NcV,WcA,PRA,EffA,'scalar',s_Wc,s_PR,s_Eff,'effcolor',0.5,'slformat','%2.2f','offset',0.03,'defsurge',WcA(:,1), PRA(:,1));</td>
<tr><td>PlotTMap(NcV,PRV,WcA,EffA)</td><td>Plot turbine map based on an Nc vector, PR vector, Wc array, and Eff array
<br> addtional inputs can be included by with the format PlotTMap(_,Name,Value,...,Value)
