        Purpose
</div>

<p>
    This block is used to supply the inputs to iteratively drive the outputs
    of a system to zero by using a <a href="TMATS_Library/TMATS_Support/NumMthd_TMATS_NRS.html">
    Newton Raphson Solver block</a> in combination with a <a href="TMATS_Library/TMATS_Support/NumMthd_TMATS_JC.html">
    Jacobian Calculator block</a> and a block that updates the inverse of the Jacobian at each iteration using the Sherman Morrison (Good) Broyden Update Method.

    This block performs its calculations by utilizing the following steps:

    <ol>
        <li>Jacobian Calculator sends perturbations to the plant and then
        calculates the initial plant Jacboian based on the system response.
        <li>Newton Raphson Solver will use the inverse of the Jacobian to
        iteratively step the system towards the solution.
		<li> At each step, the differences between current and previous iterations for the dependents and independents are used to update the inverse of the Jacobian using the Sherman-Morrison (Good) Broyden Updade Method.
        <li>Once the solution has satisfied the conditions, the Newton
        Raphson Solver is shut off.<br>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
This block is designed to be used in dynamic systems and should be paired
with a "do... while" block in Simulink. The "do...while" block and this one
should both be located in the same subsystem as the plant that is to be
solved for.
</p>

The block contains the following equations:
    <ol>
        <li>Newton-Raphson Method with Damping Term<br>
		\begin{equation}
			x_{n_{i+1}} = x_{n_i} - \frac{\lambda}{100}J^{-1}_if(x)_i
		\end{equation}
		\(i\) is the iteration number, subscript \(n\) denotes a term normalized with respect to the absolute value of its initial condition, \(x_{n_i}\) is the normalized independent at the current time step, \(\lambda\) is the damping factor, \(J^{-1}_i\) is the inverse of the Jacobian at the current time step, \(f(x)_i\) are the dependents at the current time step, and \(x_{n_{i+1}}\) are the normalized independents at the next time step.
		The Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives that describes the changes in the <u>normalized</u> independents with respect to the full scale dependents (\(x_n = \frac{x}{abs(x_o)}\) where \(x_o\) are the initial, full scale independents specified by the user in the mask and \(x\) are the full scale independents).
		<li>Sherman Morrison (Good) Broyden Update Method<br>
		\begin{equation}
			J^{-1}_i = J^{-1}_{i-1} + \frac{\Delta x_{n} - J^{-1}_{i-1} \Delta f(x)}{\Delta x_{n}^T J^{-1}_{i-1} \Delta f(x)} \Delta x_{n}^T J^{-1}_{i-1}
		\end{equation}
		\(J^{-1}_{i-1}\) is the inverse of the Jacobian at the previous time step, \( \Delta x_{n} = x_{n} - x_{n_{i-1}}\) is the change in the normalized independents between the current and previous time steps, suberscript \(T\) represents the transpose of an array, and  \( \Delta f(x) = f(x)_i - f(x)_{i-1}\) is the change in the dependents between the current and previous time steps.
    </ol>

<p>
When using this block, you may receive one of the following errors/warnings. The table

<p>
When using this block, there is also a possibility that the Newton Raphson
Solver will not converge to a solution. This can happen for a variety of
reasons, as listed below:
<ul>
    <li>The initial guess (initial condition) was not close enough to the
    desired root. This can cause the system to either diverge completely or converge
    on a secondary root of the function.
    <li>The derivative of the function is not well behaved, causing the system
    to overshoot the correct root and diverge.
    <li>The initial guess (or a resulting value after one or more iterations)
    is a point in the function for which the derivative is zero. This results
    in a divide-by-zero situation, and an error occurs.
    <li>The results of the solver hit one of the user-specified limits.
</ul>
