<font size="6" color="Magenta">T-MATS: Cantera Gas Table Builder</font>
<p> The Cantera Table Builder (CTB) works with the Cantera software package to create themodynamic
    parameter lookup tables. These tables may be used to replace current
    T-MATS tables to allow for off nominal thermodynamic paramters. It should be noted that 
    in T-MATS the fuel energy is defined with LHV or enthalpy and the default thermodyanmic 
    paramter tables represent 2 components, air and exhaust fumes (or fuel after combustion).
</p>
<p> The CTB GUI may be started by running the script "RunCTB.m". New gas property tables may then be created
    by filling out the tool GUI.
    Once the tables have been generated, the new files (pt2sc_TMATS.c, sp2tc_TMATS.c, h2tc_TMATS.c,
    and t2hc_TMATS.c) will be created in the AlternateTables folder. These
    files can be copied into \TMATS_Library\MEX replacing the 
    current files of the same names. Once copied T-MATS should be re-compiled to complete
    the installation. It is a good idea to save the current (default) table files
    before they are overwritten. A folder (DefaultTables) has been created
    to accommodate such a procedure.
</p>

    Additionally, in any model that uses generated tables the burner modules must 
    be set to use enthalpy. It should be noted that Cantera makes use of enthlapy values
    that include the heat of formation (the default tables do not) and the enthalpy value
    chosen for the burner must reflect this. Example values for jet fuel are LHV 
    may be equal to 18400 BTU/lbm (used with the default gas tables and does not include heat of formation) and
    enthlapy (used with Cantera generated gas tables and including heat of formation) may be -1200 BTU/lbm. Note, negative numbers are ok
    because the enthalpy is based on a reference zero value.

    Steps:<br>
    1) Run \TMATS\TMATS_Tools\GasTableBuilder\Run_CTB_GUI.m.<br> 
    2) input desired criteria in the GUI<br>
        Names are symbols of the reactants. These must be consistant with Cantera nomneclature and appear in the .cti file<br>
        Species are the amount by weight of each reactant in the stream<br>
        Temperature and Pressure are the points at which the table would be generated<br>
        Stream fraction range is the range of Stream2 to Stream1 to be generated. T-MATS currently accounts for two stream types<br>
    3) Copy pt2sc_TMATS.c, sp2tc_TMATS.c, h2tc_TMATS.c, and t2hc_TMATS.c from
    the MEX folder to the the Default Tables folder<br>
    4) Copy the new .c files with the same names from the AlternateTables folder 
    to the MEX folder<br>
    5) re-compile T-MATS, note this may take much longer to compile as the new tables are complete lookups and the default tables use curve fits<br>
    5) Set T-MATS burner module within the Simulink model to use hFuel for fuel energy calculation.<br>
